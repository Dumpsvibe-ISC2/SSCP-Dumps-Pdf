## Other Certifications to Consider üéì

### SSCP vs. Security+

Both the SSCP from (ISC)¬≤ and the Security+ from CompTIA are common certification options for those starting out or early in their cybersecurity career. Generally, if you‚Äôre working toward your first job in cybersecurity, Security+ might be a better option. If you already have some experience or a degree in a related field, SSCP could be the right choice.

### SSCP vs. CISSP

If you‚Äôve already gained some experience working in cybersecurity, you might be deciding between the SSCP and the CISSP. The CISSP is more advanced and typically requires five or more years of experience. The SSCP is an excellent stepping stone to gaining the experience needed for the CISSP.
